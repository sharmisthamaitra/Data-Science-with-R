#Section 5.6.7: 2) Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).

#Section 5.6.7: 5).Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))

#average delay time isn’t helpful, and the average delay time reveals F9 to be the worst, but I’m suspicious of outliers.Let’s look at the number of delayed (arrivals OR departure) flights that were delayed for more than 10 minutes. We see below that ExpressJet Airlines has the most delays by pure volume. We could also look at proportions, but you get the idea.

flights %>% filter(dep_delay > 10 | arr_delay > 10) %>%
  count(carrier, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)

#just considering flights with departure delay > 10 mins
flights %>% filter(dep_delay > 10 | arr_delay > 10) %>%

            arrange(carrier) %>%

           # count(carrier, sort = TRUE)
            #remember that sum works on numeric columns only, it adds up the values in that column. if you want to know the count of, for example here, the total count of each type of carriers , use count_carrer = n() function.

```{r}

#There may also be airports that are generally “bad” airports to fly into, which will cause both arrival and departure delays to and from that airport. Again, let’s simply look at volume of delays (we’ll just look at arrival delays and destination airports) where the delay was more than 10 minutes.

#Let’s focus on our worst carriers: EV; UA; and B6. Here, we take our three worst carriers in terms of volume of delayed flights, and then plot the proportion of delayed flights for each destination. If the delays are concentrated at a few airports, this may say something more about the airport than the carrier.

                              filter(carrier %in% c('EV', 'UA', 'B6')) %>%

#Very important revelation. Sum() under Summarise() works on columns with boolean values (true or false), like below example, it works on delayed column. But sum() doesnt work on columns with charater values, for example it cannot find the count of grouped carrier, summarise (sum(carrier)), summarise(sum(dest)) does not work. we have to use summarise(n()) function for that. Mean() also works on boolean and numeric columns, thus prop_delay = mean(delayed, na.rm = TRUE) works in below example

#6.What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?
#sort argument on count() sorts the results of the count() in descending order.

#Section 10.5: #1, #2, #3 and #6 only

#10.5 Exercises

#1.How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing mtcars, which is a regular data frame).
#mtcars is a dataframe. It can be converted to a tibble using as_tibble(mtcars).
#print(mtcars) prints the dataframe. print(as_tibble(mtcars)) prints it in the form of a tibble.
```{r}
print(mtcars)

print(as_tibble(mtcars))

```


#2.Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. What is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?

#df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
#df$x
#df[, "xyz"]
#df[, c("abc", "xyz")]


#on a dataframe
```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df
```

```{r}
df$x

```

```{r}
df[, "xyz"]
```

```{r}
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

#on a tibble.
#tibble cannot do partial matching, so df_tibble$x returns an error saying it cannot find column w name 'x'. Unknown or uninitialised column: 'x'.NULL
#
```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df_tibble <- as_tibble(df)
```

```{r}
df_tibble$x
```
```{r}
df_tibble[, "xyz"]
```

```{r}
df_tibble[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

#3.If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?

```{r}
tibble_mtcars <- as_tibble(mtcars)
var <- "mpg"
tibble_mtcars[var]

```

#6.What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?
#The folowing code can be used to print extra columns.
#print(x, ..., n = NULL, width = NULL, n_extra = NULL)

#x: Object to show.
#n: Number of rows to show. If NULL, the default, will print all rows.
#width: This defaults to NULL, which means only the columns that fit on screen will show
#n_extra: Number of extra columns to print .


##Section 12.3.3: #2, #3 and #4 only

#2.Why does this code fail?
#it fails because 1999 and 2000 have not been referenced correctly, back ticks missing.

#table4a %>% 
 # gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
  

```{r}
table4a <- tibble(
            country = c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China"),
            `1999` = c(745, 37737, 212258),
            `2000` = c(2666, 80488, 213766)
            )
table4a

#table4a %>% 
 #gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")

table4a %>% 
 gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

#3.Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem?
#The tibble has two entries for Phillip Woods and Age. A new column can be added to specify the observation, so that [Philip Woods, age 45 is observation 1 ] and [Philip Woods, age 45 is observation 2 ]

```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,  ~observation,
  #-----------------|--------|-------|------------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,    1,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,    1, 
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,    2,   
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,    1,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156,    1
)

people

people_spread <- people %>%
                  spread(key, value)
people_spread
```


#4.Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?
#Gather is needed. The variables are pregnant(Y,N), sex(male or female), months_pregnancy

```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)
preg

preg_gathered <- preg %>%
                gather(male, female, key = "sex", value = "months_pregnancy")

preg_gathered
```

#Section 12.4.3: #1 and #2 only

#1.What do the extra and fill arguments do in separate()? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.

#extra =>	If sep is a character vector, this controls what happens when there are too many pieces. There are three valid options:
#"warn" (the default): emit a warning and drop extra values.
#"drop": drop any extra values without a warning.
#"merge": only splits at most length(into) times

#fill	=> If sep is a character vector, this controls what happens when there are not enough pieces. There are three valid options:
#"warn" (the default): emit a warning and fill from the right
#"right": fill with missing values on the right
#"left": fill with missing values on the left

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", extra = "drop"))
```

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", fill = "right"))
```

#2.Both unite() and separate() have a remove argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to FALSE?
#remove in unite() and separate() means if 'remove = TRUE, remove input columns from output data frame'.
#THEDEFAULT VALUE IS remove = TRUE where input columns are separated from the output result.
#if remove = false IS SPECIFIED, the input columns are included in the output result
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", remove = TRUE)) %>%
unite(new, one, two, three, sep = "", remove = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", remove = FALSE)) %>%
unite(new, one, two, three, sep = "", remove = FALSE)
```


#Follow these steps:
#- Download the baby_names.txt file from Canvas which is in the Homework 4 assignment section.
#- Load this file into R correctly and take a glimpse of the output.
#- Export this file as an rds file and call it ‘baby_names.rds’.
#- Reload the baby_names.rds file and take another glimpse.
#- Show all of your code and the output. There should be two data import lines of code, one data export
#line of code, and two glimpses of the data.
