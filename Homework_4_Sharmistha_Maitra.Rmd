#Section 5.6.7: #2, #4, #5 and #6 only
#Section 10.5: #1, #2, #3 and #6 only
#Section 12.3.3: #2, #3 and #4 only
#Section 12.4.3: #1 and #2 only


```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```

#Section 5.6.7: #2
#Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>%
                filter(!is.na(dep_delay))
                  
not_cancelled

#dest_using_count <- not_cancelled %>% count(dest)
#dest_using_count

#tailnum_dist_using_count <- not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)
#tailnum_dist_using_count


flight_by_dest <- not_cancelled %>%
                  group_by(dest) %>%
                  summarise(count_by_dest = n())
flight_by_dest


flight_by_tailnum_dist <- not_cancelled %>%
                          group_by(tailnum) %>%
                          summarise(count_by_tailnum = n(), wt = sum(distance))

flight_by_tailnum_dist
```


#4.Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

```{r}
cancelled_flights_per_day <- flights %>%
                            group_by(year, month, day) %>%
                            summarize(
                            count_flights = n(), 
                            count_cancelled_flights = sum(is.na(dep_delay)),
                            average_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm = TRUE),
                            prop_cancelled_flights = count_cancelled_flights/count_flights 
                   )
cancelled_flights_per_day

ggplot(data = cancelled_flights_per_day, mapping = aes(x = average_delay, y = prop_cancelled_flights)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


#5.Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))


#carriers with worst delays
```{r}
carriers_worst_delay_carrier <- flights %>%
                              group_by(carrier) %>%
                              summarize(count = n(), 
                                  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  proportion_delay = delay/count
                                  ) %>%
                              arrange(desc(proportion_delay))
                                 
                        
carriers_worst_delay_carrier

 ggplot(data = carriers_worst_delay_carrier, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = proportion_delay)) +
  geom_col() 
```

#destinations with worst delay
```{r}
carriers_worst_delay_dest <- flights %>%
                              group_by(dest) %>%
                              summarize(count = n(), 
                                  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  proportion_delay = delay/count
                                  ) %>%
                              arrange(desc(proportion_delay))
                                 
                        
carriers_worst_delay_dest

 ggplot(data = carriers_worst_delay_dest, mapping = aes(x = dest, y = proportion_delay)) +
  geom_col() 
```

#delays arranged by carrier and destination
```{r}
carriers_worst_delay_carrierdest <- flights %>%
                          
                        group_by(carrier,dest) %>%
                        summarize(count = n(),
                                delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                                proportion_delay = delay/count 
                        ) %>%
                      
                       arrange(desc(proportion_delay))
                                 
                        
 carriers_worst_delay_carrierdest
 
  ggplot(data = carriers_worst_delay_carrierdest, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = delay)) +
  geom_col() 
 
 
```

#6.What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?
#sort argument on count() sorts the results of the count() in descending order.  
```{r}
carriers <- flights %>%
            group_by(carrier) %>%
            count(carrier, sort = TRUE)
carriers
```


#Section 10.5: #1, #2, #3 and #6 only

#10.5 Exercises

#1.How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing mtcars, which is a regular data frame).
#mtcars is a dataframe. It can be converted to a tibble using as_tibble(mtcars).
#print(mtcars) prints the dataframe. print(as_tibble(mtcars)) prints it in the form of a tibble.
```{r}
print(mtcars)

print(as_tibble(mtcars))

```


#2.Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. What is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?

#df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
#df$x
#df[, "xyz"]
#df[, c("abc", "xyz")]


#on a dataframe
```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df
```

```{r}
df$x

```

```{r}
df[, "xyz"]
```

```{r}
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

#on a tibble.
#tibble cannot do partial matching, so df_tibble$x returns an error saying it cannot find column w name 'x'. Unknown or uninitialised column: 'x'.NULL
#
```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df_tibble <- as_tibble(df)
```

```{r}
df_tibble$x
```
```{r}
df_tibble[, "xyz"]
```

```{r}
df_tibble[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

#3.If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?

```{r}
tibble_mtcars <- as_tibble(mtcars)
var <- "mpg"
tibble_mtcars[var]

```

#6.What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?
#The folowing code can be used to print extra columns.
#print(x, ..., n = NULL, width = NULL, n_extra = NULL)

#x: Object to show.
#n: Number of rows to show. If NULL, the default, will print all rows.
#width: This defaults to NULL, which means only the columns that fit on screen will show
#n_extra: Number of extra columns to print .


##Section 12.3.3: #2, #3 and #4 only

#2.Why does this code fail?
#it fails because 1999 and 2000 have not been referenced correctly, back ticks missing.

#table4a %>% 
 # gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
  

```{r}
table4a <- tibble(
            country = c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China"),
            `1999` = c(745, 37737, 212258),
            `2000` = c(2666, 80488, 213766)
            )
table4a

#table4a %>% 
 #gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")

table4a %>% 
 gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

#3.Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem?
#The tibble has two entries for Phillip Woods and Age. A new column can be added to specify the observation, so that [Philip Woods, age 45 is observation 1 ] and [Philip Woods, age 45 is observation 2 ]

```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,  ~observation,
  #-----------------|--------|-------|------------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,    1,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,    1, 
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,    2,   
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,    1,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156,    1
)

people

people_spread <- people %>%
                  spread(key, value)
people_spread
```


#4.Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?
#Gather is needed. The variables are pregnant(Y,N), sex(male or female), months_pregnancy

```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)
preg

preg_gathered <- preg %>%
                gather(male, female, key = "sex", value = "months_pregnancy")

preg_gathered
```

#Section 12.4.3: #1 and #2 only

#1.What do the extra and fill arguments do in separate()? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.

#extra =>	If sep is a character vector, this controls what happens when there are too many pieces. There are three valid options:
#"warn" (the default): emit a warning and drop extra values.
#"drop": drop any extra values without a warning.
#"merge": only splits at most length(into) times

#fill	=> If sep is a character vector, this controls what happens when there are not enough pieces. There are three valid options:
#"warn" (the default): emit a warning and fill from the right
#"right": fill with missing values on the right
#"left": fill with missing values on the left

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", extra = "drop"))
```

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", fill = "right"))
```

#2.Both unite() and separate() have a remove argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to FALSE?
#remove in unite() and separate() means if 'remove = TRUE, remove input columns from output data frame'.
#THEDEFAULT VALUE IS remove = TRUE where input columns are separated from the output result.
#if remove = false IS SPECIFIED, the input columns are included in the output result
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", remove = TRUE)) %>%
unite(new, one, two, three, sep = "", remove = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three", remove = FALSE)) %>%
unite(new, one, two, three, sep = "", remove = FALSE)
```


#Follow these steps:
#- Download the baby_names.txt file from Canvas which is in the Homework 4 assignment section.
#- Load this file into R correctly and take a glimpse of the output.
#- Export this file as an rds file and call it ‘baby_names.rds’.
#- Reload the baby_names.rds file and take another glimpse.
#- Show all of your code and the output. There should be two data import lines of code, one data export
#line of code, and two glimpses of the data.

```{r}
