#3.8.1 Exercises
##1.What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?
##Answer: The problem with this plot is the selection of the variables for the x axis and the y-axis, highway mileage (hwy) vs city mileage (cty) doesnt give any insight into the mileage performance of vehicles in terms of their displ, drive , class or other category . This plot can be improved by graphing (ctw vs displ, hwy vs displ) .
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + 
  geom_point()
```


##2.What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?
##width and height parameters control the amount of jittering. 	The jitter is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread is twice the value specified here.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1)
```


##3.Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().
#geom_count counts the number of observations at each location, then maps the count to point area. In the below r chunk geom_count is used for the same plot that was mapped using geom_jitter in previous question and we see a marked difference. 
#n in geom_jitter denotes the number of observations at a particular position. As n increases, the size of the circle representing n increases. If n = 0, it means there are no points in a partcular psition and thus the circle is assigned a size 0.
#When comparing geom_jitter with geom_count for plotting the same curve, I would say geom_count presents a visually easier to understand uncluttered view.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_count()
```

##5.What’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualisation of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
geom_boxplot(position = "dodge") 

```

##3.9.1 Exercises
#2. What does labs() do? Read the documentation.
#labs() is used to modify the x and y axis labels, legend labels and plot labels. It can help modify Title, Subtitle, caption for a graph.
#Example plot using labs()
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), show.legend = FALSE, width = 1) +
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(x = "cut of diamonds", y = "count", title = "diamond plot", caption = "based on analysis")
```


#4.What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?
#The plot of hwy vs ctw conveys that highway mileage and city mileage almost hold a liner relationship, as ctw increases, hwy also increases almost at the same rate . 
##Coord_fixed() is important because a fixed scale coordinate system forces a specified ratio between the physical representation of data units on the axes. The ratio represents the number of units on the y-axis equivalent to one unit on the x-axis. If nothing is mentioned for coord_fixed() , like the example below , the default ratio = 1, it ensures that one unit on the x-axis is the same length as one unit on the y-axis. Ratios > 1 make units on the y axis longer than units on the x-axis, and vice versa. 
##geom_abline() add diagonal reference line to the plot. The geom_abline has a slope and a intercept, e.g  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1).

```{r}
  ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```


##4.4 Practice
##1.Why does this code not work?
##This code doesnot work because there is a typo in the name of the variable in the second sentence, my_varıable has been typed instead of my_variable
#```{r}
#my_variable <- 10
#my_varıable

my_variable <- 10
my_variable

```


#2.Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
#-------------------
#library(tidyverse)

#ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
#geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
#filter(diamond, carat > 3)
#-------------------


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```


#5.2.4 Exercises



#1.1.Find all flights that had an arrival delay of two or more hours
```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```

#1.2.Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
```{r}
filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")
```

#1.3.Were operated by United, American, or Delta
```{r}
filter(flights, carrier == "UA" | carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL")
```

#1.4.Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9)
```

#1.5.Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay == 0 )
```

#1.6.Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```{r}
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, arr_time == dep_time + air_time - 30 )
```

#1.7.Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
```{r}
filter(flights, dep_time == 2400  | dep_time <= 600)
```

#2.Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
#Between() detects values in numeric vector that fall in a specified range. between(x,left,right) . x	is a numeric vector of values. left, right are Boundary values
#Yes , between() can be used to simplify the code for the previous questions. Below r chunk shows simplified code for question 1.4 above.
#1.4.Departed in summer (July, August, and September)


```{r}
flights %>% filter(between(month, 1 , 3) )
```


#3.How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
#8255 flights have missing departure time.
#if a flight is missing departure time, it means the flight was scheduled to fly but did not fly for some reasons. So there is a chance that other variables involving time will have missing values too.
# Variables with missing variables are dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, sched_arr_time, arr_delay, air_time. These rows with missing variables represent flights which did not fly.
```{r}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))

filter(flights, is.na(dep_time) | is.na(arr_delay) | is.na(arr_time) | is.na(dep_delay))
```


#4. Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)
# NA ^ 0 : Any variable which has NA as its value means the space is empty and NA is a placeholder to hold any number, both positive ad negative. Any number raised to the power 0 is 1 so, 
#> NA ^ 0
#[1] 1

#NA | TRUE returns this result:
#> NA | TRUE
#[1] TRUE

#FALSE & NA returns this result:
#> FALSE & NA
#[1] FALSE

#NA * 0 is tricky, I would think NA (which could hold any number) multiplied by 0 would be 0, but R shows a different answer. Unable to explain why is it so.
#> NA * 0
#[1] NA




#5.4.1 Exercises

#1.Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
#I have used select() and one_of()


```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)



vars <- c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
select(flights,one_of(vars))

```


#2.What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?
#In the following r chunk, I tried to include variable dep_time multiple times in the select() call, but R ignored the repetations in its result. 
```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_time, dep_time)
```

#3.What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
#vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
#one_of() lets us select variables using a character vector of their names instead of putting their names into the select() call. one_of goes thru the data frame and asks whether the variable name is one of the names listed in the character vector.
```{r}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights,one_of(vars))
```

#4.Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?
#The following code selects the columns with names that contain the word "time", e.g arr_time, dep_time, sched_dep_time.
#Yes, it does surprise me with its power, so instead of specifiying the time variables one after another with  OR condition in between, this simple clause contains("TIME") helps us write a cleaner code.
```{r}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```
